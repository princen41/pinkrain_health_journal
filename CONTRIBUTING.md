This project and everyone participating in it is governed by our commitment to creating a welcoming, inclusive, and harassment-free environment. By participating, you are expected to uphold these values:

- Be respectful and considerate in all interactions
- Focus on what's best for the community and users
- Show empathy towards other community members
- Respect differing viewpoints and experiences
- Give and accept constructive feedback gracefully

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before contributing, ensure you have:

- **Flutter**: Version 3.3.4 or higher
- **Dart**: Version 3.0 or higher
- **Git**: For version control
- **IDE**: Android Studio, VS Code, or your preferred editor
- **Device/Emulator**: For testing

### First-Time Contributors

1. **Star and Fork** the repository
2. **Read** the README.md for project overview
3. **Browse** existing issues labeled `good first issue`
4. **Join** our discussions in GitHub Discussions
5. **Ask questions** - we're here to help!

## 🛠️ Development Setup

### 1. Clone Your Fork

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/pinkrain-health-journal-app.git
cd pinkrain-health-journal-app
```

### 2. Set Up Upstream Remote

```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/rudi-q/pinkrain-health-journal-app.git
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
flutter pub get
```

### 4. Run the App

```bash
# Standard mode (no experimental features)
flutter run

# With experimental AI features
flutter run --dart-define=EXPERIMENTAL=true
```

### 5. iOS Setup (macOS only)

If you're developing on macOS and want to run on iOS:

1. **Create your developer settings file**:
   ```bash
   # Copy the template and add your Apple Developer Team ID
   cp ios/Flutter/DeveloperSettings.xcconfig ios/Flutter/DeveloperSettings.xcconfig.local
   ```

2. **Edit the file** with your Apple Developer Team ID:
   ```bash
   # Open the file in your editor
   code ios/Flutter/DeveloperSettings.xcconfig.local
   ```
   
   Replace the placeholder with your actual Apple Developer Team ID:
   ```
   // Developer-specific settings (gitignored)
   // Each developer should create their own copy with their team ID
   DEVELOPMENT_TEAM = YOUR_TEAM_ID_HERE
   ```

3. **Update Config.xcconfig** to use your local settings:
   ```bash
   # Edit ios/Flutter/Config.xcconfig
   # Change the include line to:
   #include "DeveloperSettings.xcconfig.local"
   ```

4. **Run on iOS**:
   ```bash
   flutter run -d ios
   ```

> **Note**: The `DeveloperSettings.xcconfig` file is gitignored to prevent committing personal Apple Developer Team IDs. Each developer should create their own local copy.

### 6. Run Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
flutter test

# Run integration tests
flutter drive --target=integration_test/app_test.dart
```

## 📝 Contributing Guidelines

### Issue First Approach

- **Check existing issues** before creating new ones
- **Create an issue** for bugs, feature requests, or improvements
- **Get issue assigned** before starting work on major features
- **Reference issues** in your commits and PRs

### Branch Naming Convention

```bash
feature/issue-number-brief-description    # New features
bugfix/issue-number-brief-description     # Bug fixes
docs/brief-description                    # Documentation updates
refactor/brief-description                # Code refactoring
test/brief-description                    # Test improvements
```

**Examples:**
```bash
feature/123-medication-reminder-snooze
bugfix/456-chart-data-loading-error
docs/api-documentation-update
```

## 🎯 Coding Standards

### Dart/Flutter Standards

- **Follow** [Effective Dart](https://dart.dev/guides/language/effective-dart) guidelines
- **Use** `flutter analyze` to check for issues
- **Format** code with `dart format .`
- **Avoid** `print()` statements - use proper logging
- **Use** meaningful variable and function names
- **Add** documentation for public APIs

### Architecture Guidelines

PinkRain follows clean architecture principles:

```
lib/
├── core/           # Shared core functionality
├── features/       # Feature-specific modules
└── main.dart       # App entry point
```

- **Separate** UI, business logic, and data layers
- **Use** dependency injection where appropriate
- **Follow** existing patterns in the codebase
- **Keep** widgets focused and reusable

### Privacy-First Development

**CRITICAL**: All contributions must maintain our privacy-first approach:

- ✅ **NO** data collection or analytics
- ✅ **NO** network requests for personal data
- ✅ **Keep** all user data on-device
- ✅ **Use** local storage only (Hive)
- ✅ **Encrypt** sensitive data locally

## 🧪 Testing Requirements

### Required Tests

All contributions must include appropriate tests:

- **Unit tests** for business logic
- **Widget tests** for UI components
- **Integration tests** for user flows (when applicable)

### Test Guidelines

```bash
# Run tests before submitting
flutter test

# Check test coverage
flutter test --coverage
```

- **Write** tests for new features
- **Update** existing tests for changes
- **Mock** external dependencies
- **Test** error scenarios
- **Include** accessibility tests for UI changes

### Testing Experimental Features

```bash
# Test with experimental features enabled
flutter test --dart-define=EXPERIMENTAL=true
```
